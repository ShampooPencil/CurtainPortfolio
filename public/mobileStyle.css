/* this is good news. it is working. when i inspect and use the phone version
the the style is gone basically. then go to desktop version it is normal.
so...right now.. start getting game plan to work on the mobileStyle.css styles.

Not im thinking just copy and past majority of the normal style.css and put in here...
then just play with it and see what i can do make it more mobile friendly...
very good though nice job me!*/
